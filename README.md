# expense_app
This was my first flutter application that i built, i used firebase for backend, mainly for database and user authentication, 
user has to set monthly budget and add the expense with that category.
There is sorting option for the data and overall money spent, left, excess spending is shown in the application, at the end of every month the budget is reset again and the data as well,
feedback, sign-out and data erase options are available for the user.
This was a great experience and learnt a lot
